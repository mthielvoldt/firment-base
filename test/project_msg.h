/** This empty file is required because every .proto file must be accompanied by
 * a .h file of the same name, which declares any message handler functions for
 * the messages defined in the .proto file.  
 * 
 * Only sub-messages that are *received* by the firmware need message handlers.
 * The top-level message (Top) and messages exclusively sent (not received) by
 * the firmware do *not* need message handlers.  
 * 
 * In this case, the .proto file defines no receivable messages => empty file.
